        <h2> Weakening Self - Identity</h2>

		<p> Each type of total institution varies on how strict they are, but they all generally use same processes of weakening self - identity, enforcing harsh discipline, and using extreme punishments.  They first weaken self-identity to make everyone basically the same.  A degradation ceremony in Total Institutions like boot camp or prisons occur. A definition of a degradation ceremony is provided by Sally Raskoff, "A degradation ceremony involves bringing shame to the individual in question by publicly calling attention to their (allegedly) errant behavior" (Degradation Ceremonies and Perp Walks by Sally Raskoff). Raskoff explains what it is but it has more of an impact than just that. It forces the person to decide if their behavior should be changed through guilt, enlightenment or fear. Near the end or soon after the ceremony, guidelines for what is expected and detailed procedures on what happens if they don't follow the rules will be given. Places like prisons will greet the participants by stripping them, providing them a uniform and showing them their quarters while explaining how the prison system works along the way. While in a total institution, the weakening of self-identity will keep happening in different forms. This isn't always a bad thing such as with religious communities since it puts them closer to God but some are purely for evil and nefarious purposes. For example nazi concentration camps gave the jews numbers to be known by, essentially stripping their name from records.  These communities can be tough to live in so it's natural their greetings can be rough to get through.

        <h2> Strict Rules</h2>

		<p> Rules are the basis of society.  Rules are everywhere from schools to government.  This is how they control people to be civilized and not have chaos.  However, stricter rules and expectations are enforced in Total Institutions compared to other places. To start with, everyone's entire schedules are determined ahead of time. This can vary greatly depending on the type of total institution. An Oil Rig worker might have their meals, work and sleep predetermined but for the most part, they have some wiggle room in their gaps. Although places like mental hospitals will have everything down to bathroom breaks scheduled if needed. Another important factor that comes into play is how the participants are expected to behave. Someone who lives in regular society can basically do whatever they want within the confines of the law. However, those who live in Total Institutions will be expected to behave in a very strict manner. Monks and Nuns have rules regarding who they can talk to, when they can talk to them and only for specific reasons. Boot camp recruits have to keep everything in their environment in tip-top shape or face extreme punishment from their supervisors. In an article by New Charter University, they mention the following,  "Drill sergeants have also been known for harshly treating new recruits: some observers defend this practice as necessary for military discipline and readiness, while others consider it to be unjustified abuse" (Resocialization and Total Institutions by NCU). This quote right here reflects how much more discipline is expected from members of this type of community, especially compared to the outside world. Overall, most, if not all aspects of their lives are controlled in some form or another by an authority figure or set of figures.

        <h2> Punishment</h2>

		<p> In everyday life rules are set and if you break them, punishments are given out.  However, in a Total Institution and in-line with their tough life styles, they are given tougher than normal punishments. Their purpose isn't just to be harsh on the individual, but they are harsh to set an example for other member's of their community.  Punishments aren't as light as a detention in school, they go along the lines of banishment, solitary confinement and execution.  Banishment will occur mostly in the voluntary types of Total Institutions since if it's voluntary, those who joined of their own free will most likely want to stay.  In other types of institutions such as prisons, different types of punishments are used such as solitary confinement. This is like putting a child in a corner, except it lasts for days or weeks and it's in a small room with almost no human contact. It can be extremely miserable for the person receiving the punishment and has actually driven people insane. In an article by Jason M. Brewslow, he talks about the 1950's study effects on solitary confinement, "McGill University paid a group of male graduate students to stay in small chambers equipped with only a bed for an experiment on sensory deprivation. They could leave to use the bathroom, but that's all.  They wore goggles and earphones to limit their sense of sight and hearing, and gloves to limit their sense of touch. The plan was to observe students for six weeks, but not one lasted more than seven days"(What Does Solitary Confinement Do To Your Mind? by  Jason M. Breslow). It's very clear that we are social creatures from this quote so to take that away from us is similar to starving us . If they can't even last a week, we can only imagine what happens to those who are shut away for even longer or don't have that option of knowing they can leave at any time. There are other, similar forms of punishment that are far less extreme though such as ostracization which can push other members of their society away from the rule breaker and make them lonely or feel unwelcome for a period of time. Lastly, there is execution which obviously permanently ends that person's life. This is generally used only in the most extreme cases and to serve as a warning to others what can happen. Often times, this kind of punishment doesn't even go through it's so extreme; it just acts as more of a threat than anything (Former Death Row Inmate Damien Echols on 'Life After Death) While of course there are lesser punishments, Total Institutions tend to be very tight about what goes on and aren't afraid to punish whenever they feel it is right.
