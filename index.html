        <p>I believe most people who have a Facebook account have seen those posts that talk about how humankind is doomed for any number of reasons from climate change to something arbitrary. That right there shows what a lot of people think about our race but I would argue that we have actually come a long way. In fact, the very ability for someone to post something on Facebook is a testament to how far we have come. 200 years ago people were still riding horses and making everything by hand. I’m not saying we are perfect beings because it’s very true we make many mistakes. Although we do learn from our failures so maybe we make giant messes but the next attempt tends to be smoother at whatever we do. Humankind is a story of progression because of its constant change in Science, Economics and political movements.

        <h2> Forced Entry </h2>
        <p>To start with, Science plays a vital role in our history as human beings. Every improvement has made our lives a little easier. When we looked at the “Breughel exhibit”, the people of that time were farming whatever they could get to grow, had very inefficient methods, couldn’t store much for very long, etc. </p>

       </figure> 
        <p>   Although give it a couple hundred years and farming has improved greatly with the advent of new knowledge. Give it a couple more years and all of a sudden the crops are becoming genetically modified doubling yields, growing resistant to the environment and other improvements. Food has changed a lot thanks to Science and we are all grateful we can be fed without having to work in the fields. e became a scientific field, it was based more on the idea of tradition and hocus-pocus. We saw in the “Age of Conservative Exhibit” that when the medical field made that change, many people had a very large improvement on life. Doctors learning about germs and simple procedures such as washing their hands saved many lives.
